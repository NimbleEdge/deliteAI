# Built-ins

DelitePy supports a subset of the Python built-ins. We are continuously adding more built-ins,
so if what you need is missing,
please file a [feature request](https://github.com/NimbleEdge/deliteAI/issues/new/choose).

Semantics and behavior of the supported built-ins in DelitePy are the same as that of the
Python language. Any deviations are explicitly mentioned in the individual built-in's documentation.

List of the currently supported built-ins:
